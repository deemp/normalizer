# Normalizer for ùúë-calculus

Command line normalizer of ùúë-calculus (`PHI`) expressions (as produced by the [EO compiler](https://github.com/objectionary/eo)).

This project aims to apply term rewriting techniques to "simplify" an input `PHI` expression and prepare it for further optimization passes. The simplification procedure will be a form of partial evaluation and normalization (see [normalizer transform](./commands/normalizer-transform.md)).

Contrary to traditional normalization in Œª-calculus, we aim at rewriting rules that would help reduce certain metrics of expressions (see [normalizer metrics](./commands/normalizer-metrics.md)).

See the current [metrics report](../report).
